            <div class="body-text-1"> On a Fence was done as part of Paths to Pier 42, a pop-up park on the Lower East Side waterfront. The project transforms the fence surrounding the park into an interactive structure that incorporates color and signage on the outside, and seating and play areas on the inside. The project inverts the function and meaning of the fence from a physical barrier to a place of inclusion. Through workshops, meetings, and volunteer opportunities, we engaged with a number of local residents to design and build the work.</div>

Four artists known for their work in the public sphere were invited to form individual teams with architect or planners to conceive of artistic, environmental, and policy-based solutions for preserving the livability of Long Island City.</div>

            <div class="body-text-5">As cities around the world seek new ways to improve their physical, social, and economic environments, they are paying greater attention to the value of public space. Provision of new plazas and parks, reclamation of existing waterfronts, and beautification of public streets are all increasingly viewed as important strategies for enhancing the quality of urban living. With scarce public dollars available, cities are teaming with the private sector in innovative public-private partnerships to fund these approaches.</div>

            <div class="body-text-6">Bounded by Front Street, Maiden Lane, South Street, and Pine Street, 180 Maiden Lane provides a well-appointed enclosed public space that was a mandatory lot improvement for Parcel 20Q of the 1973 Special Manhattan Landing Development District, one of the City’s special purpose zoning districts, repealed in 1998. The idea behind such districts is that a more fine-tuned, site-specific planning and zoning approach is needed in certain geographic areas in the city, particularly with regard to pedestrian amenities and circulation systems.</div>

At morning and late afternoon rush hours, it is a crowded corridor filled with employees going to and from the Wall Street subway station escalator and stairs located at the northwest corner. At lunch hour, it is packed with individuals sitting at the numerous metal movable tables and chairs while enjoying the wares of the various food outlets lining the eastern edge. During the rest of the day, the space enjoys a relative calm, used by people ranging from apparently homeless to bike messenger to employee on a break.</div>
